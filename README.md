# Machine Learning for Sales Forecast using Linear Regression model

## A fully functional EXAMPLE project written in Python showing how to create and train a Machine Learning model such as Linear Regression through some data
This project is an example that was built along with a journey of studies showing how to create a Machine Learning and training it. Every part of this project needs to be aware of basic ML topics such as:
* Pandas for the management of datasets and dataframes
* Matplotlib for visualization of our data in plots
* Sklearn for our training and test ML model
* Numpy for the management of arrays which contains our data
* Variables

Moreover, this project also demonstrates the core steps before getting the real data from a data table to use for training our Machile Learning model such as Linear Regression checking if the actual sales were correspondent with the predicted sales done by our ML.

## Environment
One of the easiest Python environment you will find, it is Google Collab. An environment prepared to code in Python and R, in addition to being very intuitive and customizable environment.

* Sign in with your google account
* Then Click 'New Notebook'
* And you will be ready to code

## How to tweak this project for your own uses
Since this is a simple example project, I would encourage you to clone and rename this project to use your own purposes as well as have extra libraries in code for other cases.
